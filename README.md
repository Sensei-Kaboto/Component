### What I learned

In this project, I learned a lot of concepts and enriched my knowledge in areas where I was previously lacking. Here are some of the concepts I have learned through the completion of this project:

* Selectors css:

  The `:nth-of-type` selector allows you select one or more elements based on their source order, according to a formula

  ```
  main div:nth-of-type(1){

  }
  ```

  The adjacent sibling combinator in CSS isnâ€™t a selector on its own, but a way of combining two selectors

```
	.main .category p + p {}
```

* Javascript

here the methods I used to fetch my data store in data.json dynamically  on the Html containers

```
 fetch("data.json")
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => { ................}
```

### Continued development

During this project, I learned the importance of conducting extensive research on CSS selectors and delved into various JavaScript concepts. Additionally, I recognized the value of engaging in more projects to further explore and discover new concepts.
